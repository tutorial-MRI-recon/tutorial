## Overview
This script demonstrates the extended version of [ZS-SSL](https://github.com/byaman14/ZS-SSL) library for performing scan-specific self-supervised learning for undersampled MRI data reconstruction.

## Features
- Implements zero-shot self-supervised learning technique for MRI reconstruction.
- Only requires single acquired k-space data.
- Handles multi-contrast and multi-slice data (data not provided but the script is implemented to handle the features.)

## Requirements
- detailed in the yaml file

## Usage
- Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
- Run the zs_ssl_train.py script in an environment with access to the required libraries.
- Run the zs_ssl_inference.ipynb script for the inference.
